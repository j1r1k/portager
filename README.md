# Portager - A Configuration DSL for Gentoo's Portage

Portager is here to help you maintain your Gentoo's Portage configuration sane. 

## Motivation

- I wanted to configure everything in one file
- I wanted to keep information about changes of Useflags, keywords for dependencies of explicitly requested atoms
- I wanted to clearly separate configuration of different world_sets

## Usage

See [[example/README.md]] for an example.

This library is not yet available on hackage. You can add it as a package dependency in `stack.yaml`.
